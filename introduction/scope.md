## Scope {#scope}

**This document documents the conformance requirements put forth by Version 1.0.3 of the xAPI specification that must be implemented by Learning Record Stores (LRSs).** In the case of a conflict between conformance requirements described herein and the specification, the specification is the authoritative document.

Passing conformance testing based on the conformance requirements documented herein does not mean _all_ the requirements described in the xAPI-specification have been met. Some requirements are difficult, if not impossible to test in an automated way. In the xAPI-specification are described best practices (SHOULDs) as well as permissible and encouraged practices (MAYs) which are not accounted for in this conformance requirements document.

Future versions of this document, in lieu of other conformance requirements documents, _may_ address xAPIâ€™s conformance requirements for other product categories, such as:

1.  Learning Management Systems supporting the following xAPI profiles:
    1.  cmi5
    2.  SCORM
2.  Learning Record Providers, vis a vis **content** launched by systems supporting the following xAPI profiles:
    1.  cmi5
    2.  SCORM
3.  Learning Record Consumers, such as dashboards and/or data analysis software.
