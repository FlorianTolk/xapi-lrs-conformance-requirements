# Introduction {#introduction}

The Experience API (xAPI) specification contains technical information for a variety of audiences. Vendors, product managers and developers need to know which specific information is critical to making their Learning Record Stores (LRSs) conformant to the xAPI specification.

The Data Interoperability Standards Consortium, contracted by the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative to support LRS Conformance Testing, collected and structured this information in a format that follows the document structure of Version 1.0.3 of the xAPI specification.

This document provides a detailed accounting of the xAPI conformance requirements as defined in the specification. LRS products must adhere to these requirements to be recognized as xAPI-conformant. To achieve a conformance label, all conformance requirements for the associated product must be met.
